        <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 180px;">I was born in Istanbul in 2004. Since the primary school, I was really into mathematics and computers. So, when I was in high school I decided to be a computer engineer. After I graduated from Huseyin Avni Sozen Anatolian High School in 2023 and ranked 327th in Turkey's university entrance exam, I was accepted to computer engineering program in Istanbul Technical University. As of 2023, I am a freshman at ITU and I love being at it. I have some hobbies such as playing basketball, watching films and reading books.</p>

        <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 180px;">As for my academic interests, I want to pursue a career in image processing or more generally, computer graphics. I love tinkering with the graphics. Also, I am kind of into embedded software engineering and I am one of the members of IRONBEES software team. Therefore, I have not entirely decided which career path I am going to take in the future but there is a high chance that it would be one of these two. Still, life has surprises and the future is unknown.</p>
